delphi-xmldoc
=============

Generate html documentation from Delphi xml documentation

## Credits
* Based on idea from delphi-docs (http://code.google.com/p/delphi-docs/)
* Used some portions of XSLT code and icons from NDOC (http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/) msdn2 documenter

## Requirements
Requires installed third-party XSLT2 processor: AltovaXML Community Edition
http://www.altova.com/download/altovaxml/xml-processor-community.html

## USAGE

* Make flat copy of all files generated by delphi into one directory
* Create xml file containing list of projects and place it into dir with xml's.

  <projects>
	<project name="Project1" />
	<project name="Project2" />
  </projects>

* Run script :)

    cscript.exe start.js <PROJECTS_FILE> <DESTHTMLPATH>

* `PROJECTS_FILE` - path to xmlfile containing list of projects. 
* `DESTHTMLPATH` - path where will be placed generated html's

### Example

    @echo off
    
    rem make flat copy of files
    for /r "%WORKSPACE%\Sources" %%f in (*.xml) do @copy "%%f" ".\xml\"
    
    rem Launch html generation...
    cscript.exe start.js .\xml\projects.xml .\html
